# AI Mentor-Mentee Agent

## Project Overview
The AI Mentor-Mentee Agent is a university-specific artificial intelligence system designed to enhance communication and automate administrative processes between mentors and mentees. It provides a structured platform for handling various academic and administrative tasks efficiently.

The system facilitates leave requests by assessing criteria such as CGPA and mentor approval. It allows for seamless document sharing between mentors and mentees, enabling them to exchange academic and administrative files with an integrated commenting feature. Additionally, the system supports certificate generation, allowing students to apply for bonafide and academic certificates, which mentors can verify before approval.

A chatbot interface is integrated to assist users with university-related queries, policies, and automated responses. The system also includes a meeting scheduling feature that enables mentors to set up meetings with mentees, sending automated email notifications for reminders. The overall objective of this platform is to provide an efficient and structured environment for mentor-mentee interactions, reducing manual workload and improving communication flow within the university ecosystem.
